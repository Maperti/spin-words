Install all dependencies in package.json:
`npm run install`

You need to have typescript installed globally:
`npm install typescript -g`

Start typescript compiler in one terminal windows and leave it running as jest is set up to run just with transpiled js files:
`tsc --watch`

In other terminal window run jest:
`npm run test`

Enjoy TDD.

Don't forget to make notes. Always start with test and only then implement feature.
